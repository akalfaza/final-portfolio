                        The assignment was to come up with a creative way to promote a fictional new sports drink called “Compete.”  I designed a bottle label and homepage for the brand.
                        I went through the full process of mocking up a solution to the brand's concept. First, I created the bottle labels for three different products: the original sports drink, 
                        the pre-workout drink, and the protein shake. Second, I created the low fidelity wireframe for the website home page. Last, I created the high fidelity prototype for desktop. 
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>


            <div class="container-2">
                <h1 class="part-1-title">Bottle Label Design</h1>
                <div class="part-1-col-1">
                    <h1 class="sub-title">Pre-design Thinking</h1>
                    <p>
                        The intended audience of 'Compete' consists of athletes, sports professionals, amateurs and active people.
                        People can use the original sports drink to gain back the glucose, fluids, and electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium
                        lost during exercise and workout as well as to improve endurance. The pre-workout energy drinks can be used by athelets to give their body a boost to perform best during their exercise or
                        to recover faster after an exercise. These energy drinks can also be used by anyone who needs an extra boost in energy in their daily lives. The protein shakes can be used for multiple reasons, including muscle gain, weight loss, and injury recovery.
                        Thus, I've decided that I want these sports drinks to be consumed by everyone, and not just athletes. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this session, I've concluded that:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The design of the bottle and the label should appeal to everyone. By keeping the packaging simple and minimal, the brand can reach to a broader
                            audience and not just target towards athletes and people interested in fitness. By designing simple yet unique packaging, the brand can catch the interest of the people who may not regularly go to the gym but are still interested in leading a healthy lifestyle. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The bottle should only include the most important information on the front. This way, customers can quickly understand what the product is and how to use it.
                            This would also be helpful for people who are not familiar with sports drinks, pre-workout drinks, or protein shakes. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Different than other sports drinks brands, the bottle can be made out of recycyled aluminum instead of plastic. It would be sustainable and more environmentally friendly
                            than plastic. It would generate less waste and support plastic free movement.
                        </li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Overall, simple and minimal packaging would be accesible, intuitive, and environmentally friendly, making it appealing to 
                        a broad range of users.
                    </p>

                    <h1 class="sub-title">Sketching and Designing</h1>
                    <p>To get the ideas flowing, I made quick sketches.</p>
                    <img src="./pics/sketches.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="Wireframes Presentation">

                    <p>
                        I wanted a clean yet unique look, which separated the brand from other
                        sports drink brands available. By using different colors for the packaging of the products, I created a visual differentiation 
                        to help users easily identify which product line they are looking at. 
                    </p>

                    <p>For the sports drink, I chose a black backgroud color. In the context of sports drink, the color black represents power, endurance, strenght, and intensity.
                    The black packaging states that it is an effective product.
                    </p>

                    <p>For the pre-workout drinks, I decided to use a silver background. By choosing a different color than black, I stated that it is a different product line. 
                    The color silver is also very appealing and can be distinguished easily amongst other colors. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Lastly, I used each fruit's color for the background of the protein shakes. The colors emphasize the main ingredient 
                        in the shakes. Each fruit's color for the background of the protein shakes help customers identify the different flavors of each product. 
                    </p>

                    <p>I wanted to show which fruit each drink had by adding a slice of the fruit on the packaging. This also emphasizes the natural flavors and ingredients in the drinks.</p>

                    <p> I used Figma to create the bottle design for each product line.</p>

                        I wanted to create a home page for laptop screens. In this session, I've concluded that:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li> 
                            The home page should have a simple design, a clear layout and an intuitive navigation.
                            It should be easy for customers to find what they are looking for and do the desired action quickly. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The page should showcase each product and navigate the visitors to shopping. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The page should have consistent color scheme and typography for a professional-looking homepage. 
                            Black and white reflect the brand's personality, and therefore I've decided to use it consistently throughout the page.
                        </li>

                    </ul>

                    <h1 class="sub-title">Combining Ideas into a Low-Fi Wireframe</h1>

                    <p>Using Figma, I created a wireframes of the home page for desktop screens.</p>

                    
                    <h1 class="sub-title">Style Guide</h1>
                    <p>
                        Using Figma, I created a visual design style guide that displays the main colors, typography, and components' (buttons, icons, etc.).
                    </p>
                    <h1 class="sub-title">High-Fidelity Prototype</h1>
                    <p>
                        Using Figma, I created a high-fidelity prototype.
                        I designed a clean and minimalist layout, with clear headings and buttons that guide the user through the page.
                        I wanted the font to reflect the sports theme of the brand. Therefore, I used italic font and I created a sense of speed and movement.
                        I paid special attention to text hierarchy and color scheme to make the page easy to read and
                        navigate.
                        By using contrasting colors, such as white text on a black background, I made sure that the font is readable.
                        I chose to use icons on the home page to express possible actions, such as viewing the shopping cart, finding a product through the search bar, and loging in to user account. 
                        I made sure to use icons that the user can easily understand.
