                        <p>In this project, the task was to practice the workflow of redesigning 
                            a simple website and coding one page of this website taking accesibility and responsiveness into account. 
                            I chose Yahoo.com as the website I wanted to 
                            redesign, identified the problems existing on this interface, 
                            created prototypes for various screens, and build a responsive website based on these prototypes.

                        <h1 class="sub-title">Original Webpage</h1>
                        <p>
                            I chose Yahoo.com (home page) to analyze based 
                            on usability and accessibility standards. Yahoo is the 
                            least used search engine amongst others and I wanted to figure out 
                            how could it be improved so that more people use it. I started examining the home page to find the problems existing on 
                            the website to figure out why it is one of the least used search engines. Here is what Yahoo.com looks like:

                        <h1 class="sub-title">Problems of The Website</h1>
                        <h1 class="sub-sub-title">Usability Issues</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is too much text on the page.</li>
                            <li>There are too many different items to navigate. This makes the readers take much more
                                time to read and understand the website's content. The users can have a hard time finding the information they are looking for.</li>
                            <li>The images of news and ads are cluttered.</li>
                            <li>The section on the right is very cluttered.</li>
                            <li>The website is difficult to navigate and it does not have a clear page structure. 
                                There is no hierarchy. It is hard to differentiate what's important and what's less important.
                            </li>
                            <li>There are repetitive links. There is a button for 'mail' twice.</li>
                            <li>It is a never-ending home page and the user can scroll down forever.</li>
                            <li>It is hard to learn and remember the page because it is too crowded.</li>
                            <li>The search bar is not so obvious and be missed because of the other distractions on the webpage.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h1 class="sub-sub-title"> Accessibility Issues</h1>
                        <ul> 
                            <li>Some text on the website have very low color contrast. The choice of font and color for most of the text is poor.
                                Most of the text font is really small 
                                and this makes it harder to read. For example, the subtitles above images that indicate which section the information belong to
                                are light gray and has very small font size and thin font weight; therefore, they have a pretty low contrast on top of the white background. 
                            </li>
                            <li>Most of the images does not have alternative text for users who cannot view them.</li>
                            <li>Some buttons are empty or have no value text. </li>
                        
                        </ul>
                        <h1 class="sub-sub-title"> Conceptual Issues</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is the homepage for the Yahoo and it has a search bar at the top and a navigation bar right under that, which follows the 
                                general model for a search engine. 
                            </li>
                            <li>However, the homepage contains too much information such as news even though Yahoo has a sepearte page for the news section.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h1 class="sub-sub-title">WebAIM WAVE Accesibility</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Wave Accessibilty tool is used to identify accesibility errors. By using this tool, I was able to identify the errors I had mentioned about
                            such as missing alternative texts for images, contrast issues, small text, and empty buttons. 
                        </p>
                        
                    
                        <p> The website's overall usability is poor. Usability is a quality that measures how easy 
                            to use a user interface. Usability is defined by components such as learnability, 
                            efficiency, and memorability. If I look at the learnability attribute for Yahoo.com, 
                            I can see that the Yahoo homepage is unfortunately not so easy for users to navigate and 
                            accomplish tasks when they first encounter the website. It takes longer for users to learn the website. Therefore, I can say that the efficiency of the website is poor because even though the users learn the website, it is still hard to perform basic tasks such as differentiating between ads and news, logging in to mail, or navigating through the website. The homepage also has poor memorability because the structure is confusing, crowded, and not consistent.
                            It could be hard for users to reestablish proficiency after some period of time not using it.

                        <p>
                            Using Balsamiq, I created a total of 3 wireframes of my screen, 
                            one for each of the screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop). 
                        </p>

                        <img src="./pics/wireframe-desktop.png">

                        <p>I wanted to reduce the content on the home page and only include the important ones. The user can also sign in and personalize
                        their homepage by adding other sections. I also changed the layout to make the page more organized and clean. I put the search bar and the logo 
                        in the center and under the navigation bar to attract user's attention more. Under the search bar I added three other sections which are
                        trending news, weather and a bottom bar. 
                        </p>

                            Using Figma, I created a visual design style guide that displays
                            the main colors, typography, and reusable components' different states (buttons on hover, click, etc.).
