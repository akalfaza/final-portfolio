                    <p class="introduction-parag"> In this project, we created a website for a hackathon at Brown University that generates scary stories using OpenAI's ChatGPT.
                        As the designer and front-end developer for the project, my primary responsibility was to create the visual and interactive elements of the website that users would see and interact with. 
                        This involved using my skills in design and front-end development to create an appealing and user-friendly interface for the website.
                        I worked on creating the overall look of the website, including choosing colors, fonts, and other design elements. I created wireframes to help plan out the website's layout using Figma. 
                        We later used React and HTML to build the webpage. 
                    </p>
                    
                </div>
            </div>


            <div class="container-2">
                <h1 class="part-1-title">Wireframing</h1>
                <div class="part-1-col-1">
                    <h1 class="sub-title">Inspiration & Pre-design Thinking</h1>
                    <p>
                        The theme of the hackathon was a campfire, and our team drew inspiration from memories of storytelling around the campfire with family.
                        Our team wanted to create a project that captured the essence of those experiences and brought them into a new, digital context.
                        We used the theme of the hackathon as a starting point to create a project that drew on personal experiences and memories.
                        By using OpenAI's ChatGPT to generate scary stories based on user input, we were able to recreate that feeling of storytelling around the campfire in a new, interactive way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main goal was to create a user-friendly and intuitive webpage that 
                        would allow users to easily generate scary stories. To achieve this goal, your team made several design decisions.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Firstly, the team decided to create a single webpage to ensure that the user experience 
                            is seamless and straightforward. Having all the necessary elements on a single page allows 
                            users to easily navigate the website and generate their scary stories without any distractions or confusion.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To further enhance the user experience, 
                            we chose to include a navigation bar with 'instructions' and 'about' sections.
                            This provides users with clear 
                            instructions on how to use the application, which can help to prevent confusion. 
                            The 'about' section also serves to provide more context and information about the project and your team's inspiration.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In terms of design, I decided to use a brown and pale yellow/beige color palette when creating the website. 
                            This choice was made to evoke the warmth and coziness of a campfire.
                            The use of a limited color palette also creates a cohesive and visually appealing design.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    

                    <h1 class="sub-title">Combining Ideas into a Wireframe</h1>
                    <p>
                        After your team made the design decisions, I used Figma to create a low-fidelity wireframe of the design.
                    </p>

                    <h1 class="sub-title">Designing The High-Fidelity Prototype</h1>
                    <p> I created a high-fidelity prototype of the website using Figma. I made several design decisions 
                        to reflect the theme of the campfire and enhance the user experience. One of the key design decisions I 
                        made was to choose a fun font that reflected the theme of the campfire. Another design decision I made
                        was to pay special attention to text hierarchy and color scheme. By using contrasting colors, such as pale yellow text on a dark brown background, I 
                        made the font more visible and easier to read. This is especially important for a website that generates scary stories, as users may be reading in dimly lit environments. 
                        The use of contrasting colors helps to ensure that the website is accessible and user-friendly for a wide range of users.
                        Finally, I added a navigation bar for users to view 'Instructions' and 'About'. This decision was made to help users easily understand how to use the website, 
                        and to provide them with more context and information about the project.  Including a navigation bar is a common and effective way to enhance 
                        the user experience, as it helps to ensure that users can quickly find the information they need.

                        To create our website, we used JavaScript and React for the front-end development. For the back-end, we leveraged ChatGPT's API to generate the stories. We made calls to the API to retrieve the 
                        generated stories, which we then displayed on the website. By using JavaScript and React on the front-end, and ChatGPT's API on the back-end, we were able to create a 
                        seamless and engaging user experience for our website visitors.

                    <h1 class="sub-title">Future Considerations</h1>
                    <p>
                        There are several future considerations we could implement to further develop the project:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                To increase the reach of our project, 
                                we can integrate social media sharing features with our webpage. This would allow users to share their favorite stories on
                                social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or 
                                Instagram, potentially attracting new users to the website.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                There can be other storytelling formats we could explore in the future. For example, 
                                we can consider incorporating audio, video, or even interactive elements into the stories generated by the website.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                There can be a bookmarking option to save stories and a history section to view the older stories. The ability to bookmark stories would allow users to save their favorite stories for later or to revisit stories they particularly enjoyed. This would also give users a sense 
                                of ownership over their experience on the website, and allow them to easily keep track of their favorite stories.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To ensure that the website is optimized for user experience, we can conduct user testing. 
                                This can involve recruiting a group of users to test the website and provide feedback on its usability, 
                                navigation, and overall experience. Based on this feedback, we can make further improvements.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
